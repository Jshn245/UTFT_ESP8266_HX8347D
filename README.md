# UTFT_ESP8266_HX8347D
Library to allow ESP8266 to work with the TFT HX8347D (wave-101)


Currently any examples will just light up the screen white. It fails to initialize properly. 

Mostly the UTFT.cpp file has been modified from OLD/UTFT-ESP8266/UTFT.cpp. 
The UTFT.h file has had the HX3284D definition appended to it.

The init file (tft_drivers/hx8347d/initlcd.h) has been modified from OLD/wave-101_code/lib/HX8347D/LCD.cpp 's init method.
